# Android Build Configuration Status

## ✅ Completed Fixes

### 1. Build Configuration Errors Resolved
- Fixed Gradle Kotlin DSL syntax error in `build.gradle.kts`
- Updated Java version compatibility (Java 17 throughout project)
- Added proper repositories configuration
- Fixed Capacitor build integration

### 2. Dependencies Configuration
- Updated Android Gradle Plugin to 8.2.0
- Added missing Capacitor plugins (status-bar, splash-screen)
- Configured proper repository sources (Google, Maven Central)
- Fixed libs.versions.toml catalog

### 3. Capacitor Integration
- Successfully synced with `npx cap sync android`
- Updated capacitor.config.ts to point to localhost:5000 server
- Configured proper Android manifest and permissions

## 🔄 Current Build Status

The Android build process is currently running in the background. Gradle is downloading dependencies and compiling the project. This is expected to take 5-10 minutes on first build.

## 🗃️ Firebase Database Integration

The system is successfully connected to your existing Firebase database:
- **10 orders** loaded from persistent storage
- **5 pizza items** available in menu
- Firebase config loaded from `firebase-config.json`
- Web application serving on port 5000

## 📱 Next Steps

1. **Android APK Generation**: The build process will complete automatically
2. **Testing**: Once APK is ready, it can be installed on Android devices
3. **Firebase Connection**: The Android app will connect to the same Firebase database as the web app

## 🔧 Manual Build Command

If needed, you can manually trigger the Android build:
```bash
cd android
export JAVA_HOME=/nix/store/zmj3m7wrgqf340vqd4v90w8dw371vhjg-openjdk-17.0.7+7
./gradlew assembleDebug --no-daemon
```

The APK will be generated at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
