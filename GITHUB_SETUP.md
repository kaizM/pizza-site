# Push Your Code to GitHub (Using Replit Interface)

Since git is already initialized, use Replit's built-in Git interface:

## Method 1: Using Replit's Git Panel
1. Look for the **Git/Version Control** icon in the left sidebar (looks like a branch)
2. Click on it to open the Git panel
3. You should see all your files listed as changes
4. Add a commit message: "Initial commit: Pizza ordering system"
5. Click "Commit & Push"
6. If prompted, enter your GitHub repository URL: `https://github.com/kaizM/pizza-ordering-system.git`

## Method 2: If Git Panel Doesn't Work
You can download all files and upload them manually to GitHub:
1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/kaizM/pizza-ordering-system
2. Click "uploading an existing file"
3. Drag and drop all files from your Replit project
4. Commit the files

## Next Step: Deploy to Vercel
Once your code is on GitHub:
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up with your GitHub account
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select your `pizza-ordering-system` repository
5. Click "Deploy"

Your pizza ordering system will be live at a URL like:
`https://pizza-ordering-system-kaizm.vercel.app`
