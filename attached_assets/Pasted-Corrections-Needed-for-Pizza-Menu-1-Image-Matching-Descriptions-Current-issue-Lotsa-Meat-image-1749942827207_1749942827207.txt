Corrections Needed for Pizza Menu
1. Image Matching & Descriptions

Current issue:

Lotsa Meat image is missing.
Veggie Delight shows a pizza with meat (wrong).
Loaded pizza shows a random pizza with cubed toppings that don’t align with the description.
Fix required:

Pizza Name	Correct Description	Correct Image Style
Lotsa Meat	Loaded with pepperoni, sausage, bacon, and beef — for the ultimate meat lover.	Show a full pizza with visible meats only, no veggies.
Veggie Delight	Bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, black olives, banana peppers. No meat.	Show a colorful vegetarian pizza, clearly no meat.
Loaded	Combo of meats & veggies: pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions.	Show a combination pizza with both meat & veggies.

🧩 What Needs to Be Done Next
🔄 Frontend Updates

Replace the images with matching, high-quality photos for each pizza type (I’ll help generate or source them if needed).
Update all pizza descriptions to clearly state ingredients (based on Hunt Brothers standards).
Clean up any visual mismatch between image, price, and ingredients.
Ensure only authorized user roles can access employee or admin pages.
Customer should see only order UI.
Employee/Admin logins must stay completely separate.
💡 Example Fix for Veggie Delight:
{
  id: "veggie-delight",
  name: "Veggie Delight",
  description: "Fresh bell peppers, mushrooms, onions, black olives, and banana peppers.",
  price: "$13.99",
  image: "correct-image-url-showing-veggies-only"
}
✅ Next Step for the Developer:
Fix or replace the 3 pizza cards (image + description).
Use royalty-free images that reflect the actual pizza.
Stick to one pizza size in layout — no size selectors.
Ensure any topping UI follows the Domino’s-style inline extra topping toggle, not a whole separate “extra” section.
