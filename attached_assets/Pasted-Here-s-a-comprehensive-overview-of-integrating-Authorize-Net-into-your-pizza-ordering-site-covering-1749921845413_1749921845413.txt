üß≠ Recommended Integration Workflow

Set Up Authorize.Net Account
Sign up and note your API Login ID and Client Key
Frontend Setup (React)
Install library: npm install react-authorize-net or react-acceptjs
Create form to collect card data
Use Accept.js to obtain client-side nonce
Backend Setup (Node.js)
Create an endpoint (e.g., /api/charge)
Process the nonce by calling Authorize.Net‚Äôs createTransactionRequest
Return confirmation or error to frontend
Frontend Payment Flow
User reviews cart ‚Üí enters card ‚Üí nonce generated ‚Üí nonce sent to backend ‚Üí backend completes payment
On success: record order and show confirmation
üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance

All CC data handled by Authorize.Net via Accept.js ‚Äì PCI compliant
Hosted forms via AcceptHosted reduce compliance risk
Must use HTTPS for production token exchange
