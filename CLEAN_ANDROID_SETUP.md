# Clean Android Setup - Step by Step

Your web application is running perfectly. Here's how to build the Android APK cleanly:

## Step 1: Download Project
Download this Replit project as ZIP and extract on your Mac.

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
```bash
cd extracted-project-folder
npm install
```

## Step 3: Build Web Assets
```bash
npm run build
```

## Step 4: Add Android Platform
```bash
npx cap add android
```

## Step 5: Sync Assets
```bash
npx cap sync android
```

## Step 6: Build APK
```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Your APK Location:
`android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`

## What's Different:
- Removed all broken Android configuration
- Using minimal Capacitor setup
- Clean project structure
- Proper app configuration in capacitor.config.ts

This approach uses Capacitor's built-in Android project generation, which handles all the Gradle configuration automatically and correctly.
