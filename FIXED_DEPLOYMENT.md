# Fixed Vercel Deployment Configuration

The deployment configuration has been updated to work properly with Vercel's serverless architecture.

## Changes Made:
1. Created `/api/index.ts` as the Vercel function entry point
2. Updated `vercel.json` to use the correct serverless structure
3. Simplified routing configuration

## Next Steps:
1. Push these changes to GitHub
2. Vercel will automatically redeploy
3. Your app will be accessible at the correct URL

The deployment should now work correctly with all your pizza ordering functionality.
